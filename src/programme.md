# Programme

<br>

## Day 1: Working sessions (5 November 2024)

Location: National Archives, The Hague

Expected attendees: 20-30

_The first day of the Open Maps Meeting builds common ground between expert participants by introducing and discussing a series of ongoing use cases developed with mapping tools, presented by researchers from different institutions. Their specific challenges are further addressed in parallel working sessions, which reflect the different phases of a collaborative workflow, and aim to develop concrete follow-up plans or even prototypes for solutions. At the end of the day, results are pitched by community members chairing the different sessions._

- 10u - Walk-in with coffee
- 10u30 - Community meeting introduction & presentation round of project use cases:
  - MapReader: Computer vision pipeline for exploring maps at scale (Alan Turing Institute & Lancaster University)
  - GLOBALISE: Unlocking the archive of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) (University of Amsterdam & Huygens Institute)
  - Soduco: Locating businesses on historical maps (Institut national de l'information géographique et forestière)
  - Artemis: Mapping the Scheldt valley (Ghent University & Antwerp University)
  - HisGIS: Renewing the infrastructure for georeferencing, enriching and presenting cadastral maps (KNAW Humanities Cluster)
  - Optional - Watertijdreis: Georeferencing historical water authority maps (Delft University of Technology & Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands)
- 13u - Lunch
- 14u - Parallel working sessions on the different phases of an open mapping workflow, structured according to the FAIR data principles:
  - Findable: how the discoverability of maps across different libraries and archives can be improved.
  - Accessible: how open protocols like IIIF can be used to access institutional data.
  - Interoperable: how research outcomes can be encoded in standardised web annotations, which can be used in different environments.
  - Reusable: how research data can be stored, presented and ultimately shared with and ‘given back’ to the original archival institutions.
- 17u - Concluding pitches of all sessions
- 18u - Dinner

## Day 2: Plenary outreach (6 November 2024)

Location: National Library, The Hague

Expected attendees: 60

_Like the first day of the Open Maps Meeting, the second day is open to anyone interested, but particularly aimed at researchers, curators, data stewards and open science advocates who are relatively new to the cartographic tools and workflows presented and discussed during the first day and would like to learn more about their possibilities._
